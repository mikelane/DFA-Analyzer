CS311 Project 1: DFA Analyzer

The DFA Analyzer can be run as follows:

Once the file is unzipped, type 

node DFA-Analyzer.js

to run it. Alternately, you can run it in verbose mode by typing

node DFA-Analyzer.js -v

or

node DFA-Analyzer.js --verbose

The pre-built machines are located in the Machines folder. There are 5
machines that work as they should (what each machine does will be output to
the screen as the program runs) and there is one machine that is an example of
malformed JSON. That file was included so that I could test the the error
handling of the JSON.parse function.

When the program runs, to use any of the machines that are pre-built, you'll
have to simply type in "Machines/machine4.json" (where you can replace 4 with
a number from 1 to 5). 

The rest of the operation should be self-explanatory.
